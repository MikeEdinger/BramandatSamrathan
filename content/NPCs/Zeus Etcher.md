Zeus Etcher is a tall, middle aged elf with dark skin and hair.  He's an intense person. He runs Etcher's Etchings and Exchange, basically a pawn/thrift shop.  He's a third generation Inhabitant, so his kids will be the last generation as Inhabitants; his grandchildren will be Citizens.  Still, he hates the Inhabitants/Citizen dichotomy in the city.
