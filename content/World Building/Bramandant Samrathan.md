Bramandant Samrathan is the city at the end of the universe.

This is not to say that this city is devastated. Far from it.  The city gets it's name from being the point where all universes, all planes, all realities converge.  From this city, you can go anywhere.  You can go any*when*. 

The city is a metropolis.  A megalopolis, even.  Think of the largest city you can. The most people.  The most area.  Bramandant Samrathan has more people than that.  It has more area than that.

It is a city floating in the cosmos.  When more space is needed, more land appears. When the land isn't needed, it crumbles away to primordial matter.

As a result of the city's special place in time and space, there is no shortage of wonders to behold.  Magical artifacts are tossed in desk drawers and gods walk down the street.

# Available Classes
All paizo classes are allowed and should have little to no problem being incorporated. Additionally, the following, the following non-Paizo classes are allowed:

| Class | Description | Source |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Eldamon Trainer | You're a pokemon trainer. As an eldamon trainer, your main focus is the eldamon you befriend and train. Unlike other characters who befriend eldamon, you can phase your eldamon in and battle any foe using eldamon. This gives you a flexible playstyle with several eldamon ready to fight, allowing you to choose the eldamon that's right for the job and fill several possible roles depending on what the group needs moment to moment. | Battlezoo  |
| Elemental Avatar | As an elemental avatar, you embody the power of an eldamon within you, allowing you to manifest special powers based on the eldamon's element. This allows you to fill a slightly different role in the party depending on the element you choose. The playstyle is rotational, using each ability when it suits you best rather than the same ability repeatedly. | Battlezoo |
Additionally, the supplemental materials from the Plus team will generally be allowed.

Anything flagged as common or uncommon is allowed.  Anything with the Rare tag will likely be allowed, but clear it with me first.
