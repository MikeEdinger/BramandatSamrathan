Bramandant Samrathan is massive.  It's as big as it needs to be and then a little bit more.  The City is generally peaceful, but there is still a need governing structures, both formal and informal.

Like most cities, there are distinct neighborhoods with some more homogenized than others.  The area surrounding [[Keshtraya]] is perhaps the most diverse area of the city due to it's nature as an entry point.

Groups of neighborhoods are grouped together as wards.  Wards are an official entity.  They are largely self governed, each with a Ward Council.  Each ward also sends two representatives to the City Council.  Officially, these are elected positions but each ward has it's own way of selecting representatives.  Some are actually inherited positions, some are obtained through combat, some are even bought.  And yes, some are actually elected.

Officially the City Council  is subservient to Archlord [[Wuotan]]. But he isn't seen often and largely leaves the Council to its own devices.  For all intents and purposes, the Council is the governing body for Bramandant Samrathan.
