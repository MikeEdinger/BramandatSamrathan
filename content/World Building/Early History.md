Bramandant Samrathan wasn't always peaceful.

No one knows how the city came to be. It just existed.  Waiting and empty.  Then it was not. All worlds lead to Bramandant Samrathan.  And all worlds end.  And most end violently. And so, Bramandant Samrathan's birth, or at least it's first interactions with people, was violent.

[[Ragnarok|The first world was ending]].  There were catastrophes and monsters and people were dying.  *Gods* were dying. Then a second world started ending.  Then a third. Bramandant Samrathan's peaceful tranquility was destroyed.

But people are resilient and they don't go quietly into the night. Under the banner and behind the spear of [[Odin|Wuotan]], the people drove back the monsters, weathered the catastrophes, and rebuilt the city.  More worlds would end, citizens would fight the new monsters, and welcome the new residents.

Eventually, [[The Rocabaira]] was formed.  This group sought to prevent the ends of worlds and to peacefully lead worlds to connect to Bramandant Samrathan.  The group has been largely successful at bringing new worlds to the city, and the city has not seen the destruction of an end of a world in millennia.
