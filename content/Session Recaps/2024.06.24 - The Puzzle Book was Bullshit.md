The party is summoned by Lorshor.  He informs them that an [Axiomite](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2792) named Anakim that frequented the temple had been kidnapped by men wearing an earring with the symbol of the Golvermund.  Lorshore figures the party will have a faster response time than going to the city guard.

The party is led to a house where Anakim had been taken.  The front door is unlocked because the key is the puzzle in the next room.  Which Anur solves almost instantly.  This leads to another room with another puzzle key, which Anur solves even faster.

The party then found themselves in a room where it appeared a not good ritual was being prepared, and in the center was Anakim, chained.  The party confronted another void lady, two weird eyeball men, and a sentient swirl of color and light that came to see what all the commotion was. During the fight, Anur and Aranvael awakened some latent powers.  With some tense moments of both Anur and Bandit being knocked unconcious, the party eventually freed Anakim and defeated the enemies.
