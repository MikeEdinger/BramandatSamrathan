The party, recovering from their fight with the cloaked gougers, is approached by Bahani.  She thanks them for everything they've been able to do around the grounds, protecting the various animals.  She informs them that Ezraenok would like to meet them.  She also tells them that she has no indication that Ezraenok is part of the Golvermund, only that he's had interactions with Xonios, who she/the Thalathi believe is a member.

The party approaches Ezraenok's residence and Bahani reminds them that he is an... eccentric man.  The party enters his receiving room:

He is delighted to meet them and thanks them profusely for their help.  His voice and demeanor and earnestness does not match his appearance, much to the consternation of Aranvael. Ezraenok  leads them to (one of?) his storage room, and tells the party to look around and help themselves to any item they want.  He's lived a long time and has acquired many things, not just animals.

He excitedly shares his discovery of a rare bird called a Coquicigrue. He would like the party to go to Xonios and ask him to get one so Ezraenok can have it on his grounds. The party agrees and sets off towards what they believe is his location.

That evening, just as it turns dark, they arrive at a large building that looks like a warehouse.  After seeing the letter provided by Ezraenok, he lets them in, but informs them that no one meets Xonios without fighting.  The party enters the building and finds a large crowd gathered around an arena.  They are directed towards an female centaur named Megan, who leads them to a green room. The party finds themselves quickly healed and given time to prepare for their match.

The GM is starting to get a better sense of fights that can pose a challenge to the party.  Some things he's learned: Deny Advantage is some bullshit.  Clerics with Champion Reactions are bullshit. Maguses are bullshit.  Thaumaturges, even when blinded for the entirety of the encounter, are some *high level* bullshit.

The party won the fight and presumably get to meet Xonios next session.
