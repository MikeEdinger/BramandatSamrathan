The party is given time to recover after their battle and then brought by Megan Thee Centaur to Xonios' office.  He congratulates them on winning their fight.  He tells the party that yes, he can get a pair of Coquicigrues, but that it would take him about a week.  He laments that the cloaked gougers caused an increase in security at Ezraenok's estate.  He has a proposal for the party: retrieve an amulet from Ezraenok's mansion in exchange for a hassle free acquiring of the birds.  The party reluctantly and skeptically agrees.

The party then spent then next week devising a plan to sneak back into Ezranok's estate (his butler was less than thrilled to see them without the birds).  Most of the party developed contacts inside, learned the layout of the mansion, and determined what safeguards were in place protecting the amulet.  Dry Bones made the trip to the [[Central Keshtraya Library]] in search of more information on what the amulet could be and to inform Jax of the current goings on.

The party finalized their plan.  They were able to successfully get inside the estate, meet up at the mansion and work their way to the third floor without discovered, but some suspicions were raised.  While at the door trying to disable the magical wards, a group of guards discovered the party.  The party subdued the guards.

Next session begins with one ward remaining and sixteen awareness points.
